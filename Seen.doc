'Seen'

Taken directly from a text document written at 3:49am on Feb 4, 2011


A side scrolling platform ninja stealth game in a giant world filled with floating forest islands. A D to change 'depth' of a char on forest, W S to change height in trees, and mouse to aim/ move/ action.

Main theme is to go furthest and try not to be seen, whilst killing all guards (Going a certain distance = points/ killing guards = points, too.) and unlocking clothing and weapons. (I.e. Be disguised as a guard and shit.) Seen will be randomly generated and also have random cinematic moments. (i.e. Jump to an island and hit the ledge, causing it to break, and end up hanging on a vine/ rock. Spamming left mouse button will get your free.)

Space will be jump....

First time going through will have an ending at per say 10k meters, and then player unlocks infinite mode, to unlock more stuff and more achievements. Possibly different endings. Story may not be randomly generated.

It's also going to be 8-16bit.
